# Understanding BIG O notation
# Big O notation used to measure how running time or space requriments for your program grow as input size grows

# time = a*n + b
# n = size of array , b is constant, the b will be removed in the formula since it is constant
# time = 2*100 + 0
# so the final forumla is time = a*n means time = O(n) # O means order of
